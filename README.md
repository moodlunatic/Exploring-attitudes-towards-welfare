Theory of Basic Human Values is developed by Shalom H. Schwartz and widely used crosscultural studies of individual values. There are several motivational types of values, i.e., openness to change, self-enhancement, conservation and self-transcendence.

By using human values, we can get information about the attitudes towards supporting welfare. This process can be done by using SEM methods which is shown below. This project will focus on the relation between values and attitudes of supporting welfare. I will refer to attitudes as individualâ€™s idea on favorableness of supporting certain objects. Attitudes will change in different contexts and situations, but values will be more durable.
